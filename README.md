# Portfolio

Hello all!

A lot of love, time, and effort has gone to this project. From branding to protyping and eventually writing it from scratch, it's been a great project.
It will undergo a lot of changes in the next few months, since there are many more improvements that I'd like to add. So keep an eye out for those!
